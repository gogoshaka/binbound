## Salary report

A user can report a salary:
- because he was invited to through a userprofile
- because he chose to self report the salary directly from the web site
## The userprofile

### Start a userprofile
A user starts a userprofile because:
- he wants transparency about the salary in his company, his division or his department
- he wants to poll his peers, not necessarly from the same company, but for example from the same school or from a community (web dev on twitter for example) to compare  the salary
The user starts by filling a form about his profile [(see user form]())

Once the user has completed his profile, he has to share the userprofile with his peers. For this purpose, he generates a sharing link he can provide to his peers through email, instant messaging or even orally
The sharing link is in the form of a short link

## Profile validation
To validate a user profile, the user has to enter his professional email address. A code will be sent to this email that the user has to report to the user form to validate his profile. The professional email address is not stored in lemonjohn database

## What kind of data a user can see

a user can see aggregated data for his company and for the other respondent of the userprofile
